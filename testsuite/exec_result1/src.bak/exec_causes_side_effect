In order to gain a clear and just idea of the design and end of government, let 
us suppose a small number of persons settled in some sequestered part of the ear
th, unconnected with the rest; they will then represent the first peopling of an
y country, or of the world. In this state of natural liberty, society will be th
eir first thought. A thousand motives will excite them thereto; the strength of 
one man is so unequal to his wants, and his mind so unfitted for perpetual solit
ude, that he is soon obliged to seek assistance and relief of another, who in hi
s turn requires the same. Four or five united would be able to raise a tolerable
 dwelling in the midst of a wilderness, but one man might labour out the common 
period of life without accomplishing any thing; when he had felled his timber he
 could not remove it, nor erect it after it was removed; hunger in the mean time
 would urge him to quit his work, and every different want would call him a diff
erent way. Disease, nay even misfortune, would be death; for, though neither mig
ht be mortal, yet either would disable him from living, and reduce him to a stat
e in which he might rather be said to perish than to die.
