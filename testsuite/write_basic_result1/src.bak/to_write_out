write "multiline" <- ~~~When the "History of Florence" was finished, Machiavelli took it to Rome for
presentation to his patron, Giuliano de' Medici, who had in the meanwhile become
pope under the title of Clement VII. It is somewhat remarkable that, as, in 1513,
Machiavelli had written "The Prince" for the instruction of the Medici after they
had just regained power in Florence, so, in 1525, he dedicated the "History of
Florence" to the head of the family when its ruin was now at hand. In that year
the battle of Pavia destroyed the French rule in Italy, and left Francis I a
prisoner in the hands of his great rival, Charles V. This was followed by the
sack of Rome, upon the news of which the popular party at Florence threw off the
yoke of the Medici, who were once more banished.
