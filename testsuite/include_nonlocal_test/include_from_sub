PROPOSITION II. THEOREM II.

Every body that moves in any curve line described in a plane, and by a radius, d
rawn to a point either immovable, or moving forward with an uniform rectilinear 
motion, describes about that point areas proportional to the times, is urged by 
a centripetal force directed to that point.

Case. 1. For every body that moves in a curve line, is (by Law 1) turned aside f
rom its rectilinear course by the action of some force that impels it. And that 
force by which the body is turned off from its rectilinear course, and is made t
o describe, in equal times, the equal least triangles SAB, SBC, SCD, &c., about 
the immovable point S (by Prop. XL. Book 1, Elem. and Law II), acts in the place
 B, according to the direction of a line parallelto cC, that is, in the directio
n of the line BS, and in the place C, according to the direction of a line paral
lel to dD, that is, in the direction of the line CS, &c.; and therefore acts alw
ays in the direction of lines tending to the immovable point S.   Q.E.D.

Case. 2. And (by Cor. 5 of the Laws) it is indifferent whether the superfices in
 which a body describes a curvilinear figure be quiescent, or moves together wit
h the body, the figure described, and its point S, uniformly forward in right li
nes.

Cor. 1. In non-resisting spaces or mediums, if the areas are not proportional to
 the times, the forces are not directed to the point in which the radii meet; bu
t deviate therefrom in consequentia, or towards the parts to which the motion is
 directed, if the description of the areas is accelerated; but in antecedentia, 
if retarded.

Cor. 2. And even in resisting mediums, if the description of the areas is accele
rated, the directions of the forces deviate from the point in which the radii me
et; towards the parts to which the motion tends.
