SECTION I.
Of the method of first and last ratios of quantities, by the help whereof we dem
onstrate the propositions that follow.


LEMMA I.
Quantities, and the ratios of quantities, which in any finite time converge cont
inually to equality, and before the end of that time approach nearer the one to 
the other than by any given difference, become ultimately equal.

If you deny it, suppose them to be ultimately unequal, and let D be their ultima
te difference. Therefore they cannot approach nearer to equality than by that gi
ven difference D; which is against the supposition.
