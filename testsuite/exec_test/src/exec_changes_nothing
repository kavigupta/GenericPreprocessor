SOME writers have so confounded society with government, as to leave little or n
o distinction between them; whereas they are not only different, but have differ
ent origins. Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedness;
 the former promotes our happiness POSITIVELY by uniting our affections, the lat
ter NEGATIVELY by restraining our vices. The one encourages intercourse, the oth
er creates distinctions. The first is a patron, the last a punisher.

Society in every state is a blessing, but Government, even in its best state, is
 but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one: for when we suffer
, or are exposed to the same miseries BY A GOVERNMENT, which we might expect in 
a country WITHOUT GOVERNMENT, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we f
urnish the means by which we suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge of los
t innocence; the palaces of kings are built upon the ruins of the bowers of para
dise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform and irresistibly obeyed
, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it nec
essary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protectio
n of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every 
other case advises him, out of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore, securit
y being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that what
ever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense
 and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others.
